## 1. Eyes & Periorbital Region

### Blepharoplasty (Double Eyelid Surgery / 双眼皮)

Indicators:

- Crease height and depth: Surgical creases tend to be more uniform, sharply defined, and at a consistent height across the lid compared to natural creases which often vary in depth
- "Sausage-shaped" upper lid: Overly aggressive fat removal creates a hollowed superior sulcus with a puffy-looking lid below the crease
- Crease asymmetry: If one eye has a natural crease and the other looks surgically created, or if both have an unnaturally identical crease
- Incision lines: Faint scarring along the crease line (may be hidden by the fold itself)
- Medial epicanthoplasty signs: If inner corner appears "opened" — look for tiny scars at the medial canthus, a visible pink caruncle that would typically be covered by an epicanthal fold

Natural variation to account for:

- Many East Asians naturally have double eyelids (estimated 50%)
- Eyelid crease depth changes with aging, weight fluctuation
- Makeup techniques (eyelid tape/glue) can mimic surgical results in photos

### Under-eye Work

Indicators:

- Lower blepharoplasty: Absence of under-eye bags in someone >45 while the rest of the face shows age-appropriate changes
- Fat repositioning: Smooth lower lid-cheek junction without the natural "tear trough" depression
- Filler signs: An overly convex, slightly bluish-tinged under-eye area (Tyndall effect from superficially placed hyaluronic acid)

<a name="nose"></a>

## 2. Nose

### Rhinoplasty (鼻整形)

High-confidence indicators:

- Overly narrow/pinched nasal tip: Natural tips have some width and softness; surgical tips can look "sculpted" or rigid
- Straight dorsum with no subtle dorsal hump or depression: Most natural noses have slight irregularities along the bridge
- Visible implant outline: Especially in L-shaped silicone implants common in East Asian rhinoplasty — the bridge may show an unnaturally straight, well-defined edge, sometimes visible through thin skin
- Alar base discrepancy: Nostril width that doesn't match the overall facial width (alar base reduction)
- Tip rotation change: Upturned tip beyond ethnic norms
- Breathing notch: Visible notch or pinching at the alar rim from aggressive cartilage work

Medium-confidence indicators:

- Overly defined tip in an ethnic group where broader, rounder tips are typical
- Dorsal height that seems disproportionate to facial bone structure
- Very narrow bridge on a face with otherwise broad features

Revision rhinoplasty indicators:

- Asymmetric nostrils
- Visible irregularities or contour depressions on the bridge
- Pinched or "collapsing" appearance at the nasal valve area

Natural variation:

- Nose shape varies enormously within and between ethnic groups
- Aging narrows the nose and causes tip drooping
- Weight loss can refine nasal appearance

<a name="lips"></a>

## 3. Lips & Perioral Region

### Lip Augmentation (Filler / 丰唇)

Indicators:

- "Duck lip" or "shelf lip": Upper lip protrusion beyond the nasal base line, loss of the natural Cupid's bow curvature
- Disproportionate upper-to-lower lip ratio: Natural ratio is typically ~1:1.6 (upper:lower). Overfilled lips often invert this
- "Filler mustache": Loss of definition in the philtrum columns due to lateral migration of filler material
- Hard, defined vermilion border that looks "drawn on" rather than softly transitioning
- Loss of natural lip animation: Filled lips may look stiff or move as a single unit rather than naturally

### Lip Lift

Indicators:

- Shortened philtrum with a visible scar at the base of the nose
- Upper lip vermilion show that seems disproportionate to the person's age (older faces naturally lose upper lip show)

Natural variation:

- Young women naturally have fuller lips
- Lip size changes significantly with aging
- Some ethnic groups naturally have very full lips

<a name="contour"></a>

## 4. Facial Contour & Jawline

### Jaw Contouring / V-Line Surgery (下颌角整形)

Indicators:

- Extremely narrow lower face relative to upper face width, creating a V or inverted triangle shape
- Loss of the natural mandibular angle: Where you'd normally see a gentle angle at the jaw corner, the line is smooth or overly curved
- Visible step-off or irregularity at the mandibular angle (if bone reduction was uneven)
- Jawline that doesn't match the temporal width or cheekbone width — the proportions feel "assembled"

### Chin Work (Genioplasty / Implant / 下巴整形)

Indicators:

- Overly projected or elongated chin that doesn't match the midface depth
- Visible implant edges (especially in thin individuals — palpable and sometimes visible contour)
- Perfectly symmetrical chin point (natural chins usually have slight asymmetry)
- Chin dimpling or tightness of the mentalis muscle (if an implant is stretching the soft tissue)

### Buccal Fat Removal (颊脂垫去除)

Indicators:

- Hollow, gaunt cheeks in someone young (the "model" hollow)
- Cheek hollowness that doesn't match overall body fat percentage
- Temporal hollowing without cheek hollowing (or vice versa) — natural leanness affects both

### Zygoma Reduction (颧骨整形)

Indicators:

- Flattened cheekbone projection in someone from an ethnic group where higher/wider cheekbones are typical
- Visible irregularity or step-off at the zygomatic arch
- Soft tissue sagging around the reduced area (if bone was moved inward, the overlying tissue may not fully redrape)

Natural variation:

- Facial fat distribution changes dramatically with age and weight
- Jaw shape varies significantly between ethnic groups and between sexes
- Orthodontic work can change jaw appearance without surgery

<a name="forehead"></a>

## 5. Forehead & Brow

### Botulinum Toxin (Botox / 肉毒素)

High-confidence indicators (in video/expression photos):

- Complete absence of forehead lines during brow elevation
- "Frozen" upper face with mobile lower face (the classic "Botox look")
- "Spock brow": Laterally elevated eyebrow tails with immobile medial brows, creating a pointed arch
- Compensatory overuse of lower face muscles for expression

In static photos:

- Unusually smooth forehead in someone >35 while other features show age
- Brow position higher than expected for age (chemical brow lift effect)

### Forehead Augmentation / Reduction

Indicators:

- Unusually round, convex forehead contour (augmentation with filler, fat, or implant)
- Visible hairline scar (for coronal approach procedures)
- Forehead contour that doesn't match the brow ridge anatomy

### Hairline Lowering / Hair Transplant

Indicators:

- Unnaturally straight or uniform hairline
- Visible punch graft scars (dot pattern in transplant zone)
- Different hair texture/density in the frontal hairline vs the rest of the scalp
- Linear scar at the donor area (back of head, for strip harvest FUT)

<a name="cheeks"></a>

## 6. Cheeks & Midface

### Filler / Fat Transfer (面部填充)

Indicators:

- "Pillow face": Overly convex, puffy midface with loss of natural facial contours
- "Chipmunk cheeks": Lateral fullness that creates an unnaturally round face shape
- Overfilled nasolabial folds: Complete absence of the nose-to-mouth line in someone >40
- Smooth, convex anterior cheek in someone whose facial bone structure suggests natural concavity
- Asymmetric filler distribution (one side slightly higher or fuller)
- Migration signs: Filler that has moved from the injection site, creating irregular contours

### Midface Lift

Indicators:

- High, prominent apple-of-cheek fullness that doesn't match overall facial volume
- Absence of jowling in someone whose neck/forehead shows age

<a name="skin"></a>

## 7. Skin Surface

### Laser/Light Treatments

Indicators:

- Uniformly smooth skin texture with absence of visible pores (ablative resurfacing)
- Demarcation line between treated and untreated skin (especially along the jawline)
- Porcelain-like quality with slight waxy appearance
- Hypopigmentation in the treatment zone

### Thread Lift (线雕)

Indicators:

- Visible dimpling or puckering along the thread track
- Unnatural linear pull patterns in the skin
- Irregularity that becomes more visible during facial movement

### Chemical Peel

Indicators:

- Very even skin tone with absence of sun damage signs that would be expected for age
- Sharp contrast between treated facial skin and untreated neck/chest skin

<a name="ears"></a>

## 8. Ears & Hairline (Scar Detection)

Scars are the most definitive physical evidence. Look for:

- Pre-auricular (in front of ear): Facelift
- Post-auricular (behind ear): Facelift continuation
- Within or along natural creases: Designed to hide but sometimes visible
- Inside nostrils: Closed rhinoplasty (not visible in photos)
- Columella (between nostrils): Open rhinoplasty
- Hairline scars: Brow lift, forehead work
- Submental (under chin): Liposuction, chin implant, submentoplasty

Note: Most scars are NOT visible in standard photos. Only mention if you can actually see something.

<a name="neck"></a>

## 9. Neck & Décolletage

### Neck Lift / Platysmaplasty

Indicators:

- Sharp cervicomental angle (clean jawline-to-neck transition) in someone >50
- Absence of platysmal bands while other aging signs are present
- Smooth neck with aged face (disconnect)

### Neck Liposuction

Indicators:

- Defined jawline with submental hollowing
- Skin laxity without submental fat (deflated appearance)

<a name="body"></a>

## 10. Body Regions (when visible)

### Breast Augmentation

- Upper pole fullness that defies gravity (round implant look)
- Breasts that maintain shape in all positions (natural breasts change with gravity)
- Visible implant edge or rippling (especially in thin individuals)
- Incision scars: inframammary fold, periareolar, or axillary

### Liposuction

- Localized contour irregularities
- Skin surface waviness
- Disproportionate fat distribution (very lean in one area, natural in others)

### BBL (Brazilian Butt Lift)

- Disproportionate hip/buttock fullness relative to thighs and waist
- Unnaturally round/projected buttocks with a very narrow waist
- Shelf-like appearance at the lateral buttock

## 12. Ethnic Baseline References

Detection accuracy depends on understanding what's "normal" for a given genetic background. These are statistical averages — individual variation is huge.

### East Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Korean)

- Epicanthal folds present in ~50%
- Flatter nasal bridge, wider alar base
- Wider bizygomatic (cheekbone) width
- Shorter, flatter chin projection on average
- Single eyelid in ~50%
- Common procedures: double eyelid, rhinoplasty (bridge augmentation), V-line jaw, epicanthoplasty

### South Asian

- Higher nasal bridge than East Asian, lower than European
- Fuller lips
- Wider nasal base
- Common procedures: rhinoplasty (tip refinement), skin lightening treatments

### European/Caucasian

- Higher nasal bridge, narrower alar base
- More projected chin
- Double eyelid universal
- Common procedures: rhinoplasty (reduction), lip augmentation, breast augmentation, Botox

### African/African-descent

- Wider nasal base, flatter bridge
- More prominent lips
- Broader facial structure
- Common procedures: rhinoplasty (bridge augmentation + tip refinement), body contouring

### Middle Eastern

- Prominent nasal dorsum (often with dorsal hump)
- Strong brow ridge
- Common procedures: rhinoplasty (reduction), brow work

Critical reminder: These are rough statistical baselines for detection purposes only. Individual variation within any group is enormous. Mixed ancestry is common and creates naturally "unusual" combinations that should NOT be flagged as surgical.
